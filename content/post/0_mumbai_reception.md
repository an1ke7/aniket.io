April 30th, 2017, The day to meet my fellow peers at the W.P.Carey School of Business at Arizona State University organized Reception in Mumbai. The location was J W Marriott, Juhu, Mumbai. The dress code was Business Casuals. It started as a networking event for all the future students gathered there.

There was a session where the course coordinators described the journey ahead and some aspects of life in Tempe, which is awaiting us. Along with the admission coordinators, Professor Raghu Santanam from Information Systems Department was also present. We had our bunch of questions and doubts clarified by the faculty and course coordinators. It was also an excellent platform for parents and faculty to connect. It was an experience where we entered alone and left with a bunch of friends and prospective roommates.

W.P.Carey School of Business is one of the very few schools that arrange such events before the start of the academic year across the world for prospective students. Cheers to W.P.Carey School of Business.
