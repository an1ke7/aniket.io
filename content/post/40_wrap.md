<h3> 2nd May: Marketing Final Exam </h3>

The exam was at 6 in the evening. The exam was similar to the Assignment patterns. 3 hours, 30 questions, open book, open notes, coding in R and submitting the code as well. The last exam, and then the journey will be finally complete.

<h3> Skateboard group: </h3>

One of the skills I learned here includes Skateboarding. It’s not that easy by the way. Something to try and learn.
