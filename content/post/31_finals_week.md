<h3> 27th Feb: Capstone Project Interim Presentation </h3>

Since my Capstone project client outside of Arizona, we only have telephonic meetings. So for the Interim Project presentation was done in front of the Project Mentor only. Just a 15-minute presentation for showcasing the progress and path ahead. Some teams had onsite project presentations as well if the client requested it.

<h3> 2nd March: Decision Modeling Final </h3>

Exam 3 of Decision modeling and then we are free for the Spring break. The exam pattern of this subject is also a bit different, for multiple-choice questions, you can give a second answer as well. That means, if your 1st option is correct, you get 4 marks, and if your 2nd option is correct, you score 1 mark. So you have about a 50% chance of getting some marks in every question even when you don’t know the answer.

<h3> Gililland Middle School </h3>

This time, we went ahead and demonstrated Morse code patterns on Raspberry Pi to Middle school students. I wrote the code for the generation of Morse code design using 2 LEDs. The blinking pattern of LED’s is used to identify dot and dash patterns. The code is available on my git hub repository.
