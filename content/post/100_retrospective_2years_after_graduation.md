I graduated from Arizona State University with a Masters Degree on that day. It's been 2 years since then. This is a retrospective analysis of what worked as planned and what didn't.

And let me tell the current batch of 2020 graduates when I graduated on that day, I did not have any job offer in my hand. I was still applying for jobs all day. Remember, it's will always be dark before the sun rises, but the sun will rise eventually and then there will be light.

## My Retrospective Analysis:

### Why I choose a Masters in Business Analytics?
- To learn further and get a credible educational qualification.
- To advance my career in this new promising field.
- To get an opportunity to practice my new skills in the innovative US industry.

### What didn't work:
- I graduated without any job offer in hand. It took me another month and a half to secure a job offer.
- My dream job was to become a Data Scientist, but my first job was that of a Financial Analyst.

### What worked:
- In 2019, I started working as a Data Scientist at American Express.

Graduation was not the end, it was a new beginning. New success stories to be written from now. New opportunities to explore. Remember that struggle never ends, because that's how you make progress. I believe I have accomplished what I wanted from this education, but it was not instant, it took a few years.

When I look back, I see that I have made quite a lot of progress in my career. Yes, there was a struggle even after graduation, and there will be a lot of struggle even tomorrow. Always remember to never lose hope, and keep giving your 100% to everything and every opportunity. In an independent survey conducted with the 2018 batch of MSBA Graduates, 54% said they are satisfied, and 37% answered may be satisfied with their career progression after graduation.
