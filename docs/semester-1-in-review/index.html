  <h3 id="cis-505-intro-to-enterprise-analytics">CIS 505: Intro to Enterprise Analytics</h3>
<p>This course is all about database fundamentals, data modeling, dimensional modeling, visualization, and Business Intelligence. Understanding how and where data is stored in the Enterprise Data Warehouse? SQL is part of the syllabus and is taught from the very basics. The basics of Tableau is also explained in class at the very end. You will need a lot of practice (other than class time) to master both skills: SQL and Tableau.</p>
<p><strong>Tools covered:</strong> MySQL workbench, Tableau</p>
<h3 id="cis-508-data-mining-i">CIS 508: Data Mining I</h3>
<p>Interested in being a Data Scientist? Then this course is critical for you. Machine learning algorithms and using them to solve Kaggle problems. No programming pre-requisite is required for this course. All algorithms are executed in Microsoft AzureML free account. All assignments are Kaggle problems. The mathematical model of all the algorithms is not covered. Instead, the course focuses on the implementation of the model, hyper-parameter tuning and result interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Tools covered:</strong> AzureML</p>
<h3 id="scm-516-intro-to-applied-analytics">SCM 516: Intro to Applied Analytics</h3>
<p>This course covers the necessary Statistics required for the program. Hypothesis testing, ANOVA tests, Chi-square test along with some regression models. Regression models in SAS are covered at the end, but not in much detail.</p>
<p><strong>Tools covered:</strong> StatTools, SAS</p>
<h3 id="scm-517-data-driven-quality-management">SCM 517: Data-Driven Quality Management</h3>
<p>This course is an Industrial Engineering subject with a focus on data-driven techniques. Control Charts and Design of Experiments are the most important focal points in this class. Many mathematical problems, where data is provided, and we need to interpret the results. Understanding the DMAIC process, Six Sigma and the Lean principle is also part of this class. This subject requires a lot of thinking, especially for data interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Tools covered:</strong> StatTools, Mini-tab</p>
<h3 id="scm-518-analytical-decision-modeling-i">SCM 518: Analytical Decision Modeling I</h3>
<p>This course is about prescriptive analytics, where we suggest resource allocation to optimize the output function. This subject requires a lot of thinking. One problem can take about 15 min-20 minutes to solve it if it’s a medium level problem. Excel’s Solver Add-in is used to solve the model. The book also has some challenging problems (which are not covered in class), and it requires you to squeeze all your brains&rsquo; energy to solve them.</p>
<p><strong>Tools covered:</strong> Excel’s Solver Add-in</p>
<h3 id="mgt-594-job-search-strategies">MGT 594: Job Search Strategies</h3>
<p>This is an optional course that goes through some tips and tricks of Job hunting in the USA. It&rsquo;s a very different kind of hiring culture here in the USA.
