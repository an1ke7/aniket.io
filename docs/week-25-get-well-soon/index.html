  <h3 id="17th-january-2018-the-cold-wave-is-coming">17th January 2018: The Cold-wave is coming!</h3>
<p>Until last week, the lowest temperature was about 10 degrees Celsius, but starting this week, looks like some cold wave it hitting Tempe, lowering it to 3 degree Celsius again for a few days. Many folks are even getting sick these days, like widespread coughing around the campus. Maybe be the weather is facilitating the spread of diseases. Also, I caught a cough and fever.</p>
<p>Next week looks packed with two W.P.Carey Career Fairs, one for the &lsquo;Information Systems and Business Analytics&rsquo; Career Fair and the other is &lsquo;Spring to Success Business&rsquo; Career Fair. While others were preparing for the fair, I was trying my best to recover my health, but sadly, the cough was always in an ever-increasing direction. It showed no signs of stopping. I hadnâ€™t brought many medicines from India, so I was dependent on my roommates. They had multiple medications for me, but sadly none seemed to work.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Abhishek, Samarth, Sarath, and Pooja for all the help and support during my sick days. All your medicines and local solutions from usual kitchen stuff undoubtedly helped a lot.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, there are short tests in every Data Mining 2 class and an exercise question submission before every Data Modeling 2 class. So it has been a busy kind of week. The good thing is Python is taught from the very basics. I had studied basic Python programming back in 2014, but after this class, I realized I hadn&rsquo;t studied all the basics.</p>
