  <h2 id="may-7th-2018">May 7th, 2018:</h2>
<p><img src="https://aniket.io/images/MSBA/100/graduation.JPG" alt="Group Photo MSBA">
I graduated from Arizona State University with a Masters Degree on that day. It&rsquo;s been 2 years since then. This is a retrospective analysis of what worked as planned and what didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And let me tell the current batch of 2020 graduates when I graduated on that day, I did not have any job offer in my hand. I was still applying for jobs all day. Remember, it&rsquo;s will always be dark before the sun rises, but the sun will rise eventually and then there will be light.</p>
<h2 id="my-retrospective-analysis">My Retrospective Analysis:</h2>
<h3 id="why-i-choose-a-masters-in-business-analytics">Why I choose a Masters in Business Analytics?</h3>
<ul>
<li>To learn further and get a credible educational qualification.</li>
<li>To advance my career in this new promising field.</li>
<li>To get an opportunity to practice my new skills in the innovative US industry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-didnt-work">What didn&rsquo;t work:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I graduated without any job offer in hand. It took me another month and a half to secure a job offer.</li>
<li>My dream job was to become a Data Scientist, but my first job was that of a Financial Analyst.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-worked">What worked:</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 2019, I started working as a Data Scientist at American Express.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graduation was not the end, it was a new beginning. New success stories to be written from now. New opportunities to explore. Remember that struggle never ends, because that&rsquo;s how you make progress. I believe I have accomplished what I wanted from this education, but it was not instant, it took a few years.</p>
<p>When I look back, I see that I have made quite a lot of progress in my career. Yes, there was a struggle even after graduation, and there will be a lot of struggle even tomorrow. Always remember to never lose hope, and keep giving your 100% to everything and every opportunity. In an independent survey conducted with the 2018 batch of MSBA Graduates, 54% said they are satisfied, and 37% answered may be satisfied with their career progression after graduation.</p>
